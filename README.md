## Celebrate the good times!

This module lets you shoot confetti with either some handy-dandy buttons on the chat sidebar or via provided macros. You can configure the style and color choices of your confetti and these changes will be shown to other players when you fire! Also, if needed, you can change some settings to prevent certain effects from being displayed, see below for more details.

## Compatibility

No known issues at this time, but if you spot any be sure to report it.

## API

After the hook `celebrateApiReady` is fired (the hook itself also passes the api in the first argument), the following api methods are expected to be on `game.modules.get('celebrate').api`:

### `confettiStrength`

a javascript object:

```js
const confettiStrength = {
  low: 0,
  med: 1,
  high: 2,
};
```

### `confettiStyles`

a javascript object:

```js
const confettiStyles = {
  default: 'default',
  base: 'base',
  glitter: 'glitter',
  baseGlitter: 'baseGlitter',
};
```

### `confettiTextures`

a javascript object:

```js
const confettiTextures = {
  classic: 'classic',
  circle: 'circle',
  crescent: 'crescent',
  skull: 'skull',
  star: 'star',
};
```

### `getShootConfettiProps(strength: (0 | 1 | 2), options?: {style?, scale?, color?, glitterStr?, texture?})`

Returns the properties that `handleShootConfetti` and `shootConfetti` use based on the strength and optional parameters you feed it.

### `handleShootConfetti({ amount, ...shootConfettiProps }: ShootConfettiProps)`

Makes the appropriate amount of confetti fire on only the current user's screen.

### `shootConfetti(shootConfettiProps: ShootConfettiProps)`

Makes the appropriate amount of confetti fire on all clients' screens.

### Example:

```js
let celebrateApi;

Hooks.once('celebrateApiReady', (api) => {
  celebrateApi = api;
});

function makeConfetti(isSecretCelebration) {
  const strength = celebrateApi.confettiStrength.low;
  const shootConfettiProps = celebrateApi.getShootConfettiProps(strength);
  const glitterStyle = celebrateApi.confettiStyles.baseGlitter;
  const fancyConfettiProps = celebrateApi.getShootConfettiProps(strength, {
    style: glitterStyle,
    scale: 0.5,
    color: '#ff0000',
    glitterStr: 255,
    texture: 'star'
  });

  if (isSecretCelebration) {
    // I only want this to happen on my user's screen
    celebrateApi.handleShootConfetti(shootConfettiProps);
  } else {
    // I want confetti on all connected users' screens
    celebrateApi.shootConfetti(fancyConfettiProps);
  }
}
```

## Known Issues

- Spamming the confetti buttons could cause serious slow down or crashes. That's what the Fire Limit is for.
- If you set the Confetti Multiplier to max, things could get dicey, but it largely depends on your machine.
